## Become A Committer of Apache Kyuubi

Anyone being supportive of the community and working in any of the
CoPDoC areas can become an Apache Kyuubi committer. The CoPDoC is an
acronym from ASF to describe how we recognize your contributions not
only by code.

- **Co**mmunity - You can join us via our mailing list, issue
  trackers, discussions page to interact with community members, and
  share vision and knowledge
- **P**roject - a clear vision and consensus are needed
- **Do**cumentation - without it, the stuff remains only in the minds
  of the authors
- **C**ode - discussion goes nowhere without code

Apache Kyuubi community strives to be meritocratic. Thus, once someone
has contributed sufficiently to any area of CoPDoC they can be a
candidate for committer-ship and at last voted in as a Kyuubi
committer. Being an Apache Kyuubi committer does not necessarily mean
you must commit code with your commit privilege to the codebase; it
means you are committed to the Kyuubi project and are productively
contributing to our community's success.

### Committer requirements:

There are no strict rules for becoming a committer or PMC member.
Candidates for new committers are typically people that are active
contributors and community members. Anyway, if the rules can be
clarified a little bit, it can somehow clear the doubts in the minds
of contributors and make the community more transparent, reasonable,
and fair.

#### Continuous contributions

Committer candidates should have a decent amount of continuous
engagements and contributions (fixing bugs, adding new features,
writing documentation, maintaining issues boards, code review, or answering
community questions) to Kyuubi either by contributing to the codebase
of the main website or Kyuubi's GitHub repositories.

- +3 months with light activity and engagement.
- +2 months of medium activity and engagement.
- +1 month with solid activity and engagement.

#### Quality of contributions
- A solid general understanding of the project
- Well tested, well-designed, following Apache Kyuubi coding
  standards, and simple patches.
- Well-organized and detailed user-oriented documentation.

#### Community involvement

- Be active, courteous, and respectful on the dev mailing list and
  help mentor newer contributors
  and users.
- Be active, courteous, and respectful on the issue tracker for
  project maintenance
- Be active, courteous, and respectful for pull requests reviewing
- Be involved in the design road map discussions with a professional
  and diplomatic approach even if there is a disagreement
- Promoting the project by writing articles or holding events
-
