## Become A PMC member of Apache Kyuubi

Anyone being supportive of the community and working in any of the
CoPDoC areas can become an Apache Kyuubi PMC member.
The CoPDoC is an acronym from ASF to describe how we recognize your
contributions not only by code.

- **Co**mmunity - You can join us via our mailing list, issue
  trackers, discussions page to interact with community members, and
  share vision and knowledge
- **P**roject - a clear vision and consensus are needed
- **Do**cumentation - without it, the stuff remains only in the minds
  of the authors
- **C**ode - discussion goes nowhere without code

Apache Kyuubi community strives to be meritocratic. Thus, once someone
has contributed sufficiently to any area of CoPDoC they can be a
candidate for PMC membership and at last voted in as a Kyuubi
PMC member. The PMC should take an active role in watching committers
develop as community participants.

## PMC member requirements:

There are no strict rules for becoming a PMC member. Candidates for
new PMC member are typically committers that are stilling actively
participate in the community development after obtaining the committer
membership, or contributors and community members that make significant
contributions to the community for both code and contributor develop.

It is a clear goal of Kyuubi to have all committers participate in
the PMC based on their contributions, which are considered at a
community level (not just a technical one).

### Continuous contributions

PMC member candidates should have a decent amount of continuous
engagements and contributions (fixing bugs, adding new features,
writing documentation, maintaining issues boards, code review,
mentoring new contributors, and answering community questions)
to the Kyuubi codebase and community.

- +5 months with light activity and engagement.
- +4 months of medium activity and engagement.
- +3 month with solid activity and engagement.

### Quality of contributions
 
- A solid general understanding of the project
- Well tested, well-designed, following Apache Kyuubi coding
  standards, and simple patches.
- Well-organized and detailed user-oriented documentation.

### Community involvement

- Be active, courteous, and respectful on the dev mailing list and
  help mentor newer contributors
  and users.
- Be active, courteous, and respectful on the issue tracker for
  project maintenance
- Be active, courteous, and respectful for pull requests reviewing
- Be involved in the design road map discussions with a professional
  and diplomatic approach even if there is a disagreement
- Promoting the project by writing articles or holding events
