Hi Kyuubi Community,

The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Kyuubi
has invited ${COMMITTER_NAME} to become a committer and we are pleased 
to announce that they have accepted.

### add specific details here ###

Being a committer enables easier contribution to the
project since there is no need to go via the patch
submission process. This should enable better productivity.
A PMC member helps manage and guide the direction of the project.

Please join me in congratulating ${COMMITTER_NAME}!

Yours,
The Apache Kyuubi PMC
```
