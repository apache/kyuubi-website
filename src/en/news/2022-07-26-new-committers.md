The Podling Project Management Committee (PPMC) for Apache Kyuubi
has invited [Qingbo Jiao](https://github.com/jiaoqingbo) to become our committers and
we are pleased to announce that he has accepted.

He is currently working for AsiaInfo.

Qingbo contributed to several modules in Kyuubi consistently over 9 months.

In detail, his contributions are as follows

- Kyuubi Spark TPC-H Connector design and implementation
- Rework Kyuubi Hive JDBC driver to get rid of Hive dependencies
- Flink engine improvement
- Publish an article to show how to integrate Kyuubi w/ Apache Ambari[2]
- Bug fix and docs improvement.

Please join me in congratulating Qingbo Jiao!

Being a committer enables easier contribution to the
project since there is no need to go via the patch
submission process. This should enable better productivity.
A PPMC member helps manage and guide the direction of the project.
