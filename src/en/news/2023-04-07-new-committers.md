The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Kyuubi
has invited [Yaodong Zhang](https://github.com/iodone) to become our committer and
we are pleased to announce that he has accepted.

Yaodong Zhang is currently working on Xiaomi, he has been working for

  - Kyuubi Spark Lineage field-level lineage analysis
  - Support for Trino-JDBC connection to Kyuubi
  - Introduce the EventBus module to unify the distribution and subscription of Kyuubi events
  - Bug fixes and optimization work related to Kyuubi Server and engine

Please join me in congratulating Yaodong!

Being a committer enables easier contribution to the
project since there is no need to go via the patch
submission process. This should enable better productivity.
A PMC member helps manage and guide the direction of the project.
