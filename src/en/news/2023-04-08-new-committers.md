The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Kyuubi
has invited [Denis Krivenko](https://github.com/dnskr) to become our committer and
we are pleased to announce that he has accepted.

Denis Krivenko has been contributing to Kyuubi since Dec. 2022, he made major
improvements to the Kyuubi Helm chart.

Please join me in congratulating Denis!

Being a committer enables easier contribution to the
project since there is no need to go via the patch
submission process. This should enable better productivity.
A PMC member helps manage and guide the direction of the project.
